# DynamicAdaptiveFilterV2
DynamicAdaptiveFilterV2 is a versatile Arduino library for filtering sensor data and analog signals with adaptive filters (EMA, SMA, FIR). It is suitable for applications such as environmental sensors (e.g., BME680, SHT31), potentiometers, and voltage measurements (e.g., Vbus/Vcc).
